 # A new step
 ###
Here is the point: several people have clothes in their closet that they don't wear and maybe it needs a new destination. Here are some of them.
###
**1. Donation**
 
 Another option is to donate. You can separate some pieces to give, so you help people and institutions in need. You can donate clothing directly to organizations or care centers and participate in fundraising campaigns, taking the pieces to a collection point.

###
**2. Sale**
###
When a clothing or footwear is still in good condition and you no longer want, the first option is to sell the piece in thrift stores in your city or online. You practice collaborative and circular economics and still make money.
