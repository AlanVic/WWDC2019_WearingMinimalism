 # Myself
 ###
 My name is Alan Victor Paulino de Oliveira, I'm 22 years old. I'm currently a Telecomunication Engineering Student and an Apple Developer Academy Student. I've been an Apple Developer Academy student for about 1 year now.
 I love to code, help people and talk with my friends. I love my family, my friends and my mother, in fact, she is the main reason I chose this theme for this playground.
 
 # Motivation
 
 Every day I walk in my city and I see many people in the street and I imagine that each one needs clothes but there are many who buy clothes without necessity. My mother has a thrift store that sells used clothes and many people like the initiative.
 
 # Credits
 ###
 Many images are drawn by my self. All of them are vectorized by me.
 
 # References
 - Note:
 I used the tamplete to PlaygroundBooks from the Apple developer website to start the project.
